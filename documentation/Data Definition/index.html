Developers must design a data structure that allows for content re-use, and supports both personalization and testing. The process of defining data templates and building a Sitecore tree runs parallel with breaking designs or static HTML up into reusable components. Content and presentation are both modular in Sitecore, and a key responsibility of the developer is to make sure that they work in harmony to support key marketing features and the Page Editor.
