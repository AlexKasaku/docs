A contact can be extended by adding custom **facets** to it (not to be confused with search facets or goal facets). Unlike tags, facets are formally defined in configuration. Facets are defined in configuration: ``Sitecore.Analytics.Model.config``. That's it - there are no 'facet items' in Sitecore. 

Adam Conn has written a [good introduction to creating custom facets](http://www.sitecore.net/Learn/Blogs/Technical-Blogs/Getting-to-Know-Sitecore/Posts/2014/09/Introducing-Contact-Facets.aspx).
