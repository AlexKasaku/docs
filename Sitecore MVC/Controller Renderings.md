Controller Renderings
##################

A controller rendering is an advanced component type that allows you to specify a **controller** and an **action** on the component definition item. The action [must return a result that can be rendered](http://mhwelander.net/2014/04/09/sitecore-controller-rendering-action-results-what-can-i-return/) - such as a view. The controller itself does not need to inherit from a Sitecore-specific class - it is just a normal MVC controller.
