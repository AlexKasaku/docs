## Outcomes


“An outcome is the business significant result of a dialogue between a contact and a brand.”

A business significant result could mean the following:

Think of an organisation looking to run a campaign to get sign ups for a website; marketers can run MV tests and personalisation across the site to try and push people to the sign up. 
So in this instance the sign up of users is the business significant result.

Essentially, Outcomes are similar to Goals, but they offer a more meaningful way of recording the result of a user's interactions 

Typical examples of Outcomes are Contact Acquisition or Sales Lead.
